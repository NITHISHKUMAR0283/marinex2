## 🔧 CLAUDE CODE IMPLEMENTATION METHODOLOGY

### Optimal Claude Code Usage Pattern

#### 1. Research & Planning Phase
```markdown
**When to use**: Beginning of each major component
**Claude Code Tools**: Task tool for complex research, Read tool for existing code
**Approach**: 
- Use Task tool to research ARGO data formats and standards
- Read similar projects and implementations
- Plan architecture before coding

**Example Usage**:
"Use the Task tool to research ARGO NetCDF file formats, quality control procedures, and common oceanographic analysis patterns. I need to understand the data complexity before implementing the processing pipeline."
```

#### 2. Implementation Phase
```markdown
**When to use**: Active development of components
**Claude Code Tools**: Write, Edit, MultiEdit tools for code creation
**Approach**:
- Use prompts from CLAUDE_PROMPTS_LIBRARY_OPTIMIZED.md
- Implement incrementally with testing at each step
- Follow the exact specifications from REQUIREMENTS_ANALYSIS_DEEP.md

**Example Usage**:
Copy the "Advanced Database Architecture Prompt" from the Claude prompts library and use it exactly as written to create the PostgreSQL schema.
```

#### 3. Integration & Testing Phase
```markdown
**When to use**: Connecting components and ensuring quality
**Claude Code Tools**: Bash tool for testing, Grep tool for debugging
**Approach**:
- Use Bash tool to run comprehensive test suites
